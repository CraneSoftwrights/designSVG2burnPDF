These are Crane's stylesheets for working with "design SVG" files, available
publicly in https://github.com/CraneSoftwrights/designSVG2burnFiles

The PDF files are suitable for a laser cutter where cut directives are
lines with the width .001in. For distinction, these lines are magenta
coloured. All other lines are simply burned on the wood surface.

The resources available are:

  designSVG2burnFiles.xsl - convert a design SVG file into a set of burn files
  designSVG2burnFiles.html -  stylesheet documentation
  
  convertBadStrokes4designSVG.xsl - convert bad strokes found in design SVG
  convertBadStrokes4designSVG.html - stylesheet documentation
